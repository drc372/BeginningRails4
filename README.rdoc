== README

This is just a sample application I'm using to learn Rails.  Went through the Beginning Rails 4 Blog Tutorial and have added extra modules to see how Admin/Testing/Performance can be done using rails.  

Currently at page 219 - Chapter 11: Testing - Just Read.  Will actually follow RSpec for testing

This application will be used to test additional Ruby packages.
